# COCO-pwsdde
A replica of [PWSDDE-cont](https://github.com/Tudesz/PWSDDE-cont) built using the [COCO](https://sourceforge.net/projects/cocotools/) *"coll"* toolbox
- Replaces the high order Chebyshev polynomials with a multi-interval low-order Legrende polynomial base
- Reduces the effect of interpolation errors during numeric differentiation
- Better suited for dealing with PWS systems with neutral delays
